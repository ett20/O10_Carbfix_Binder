@article{OELKERS2018,
	abstract = {The in-situ carbonation of basaltic rocks could provide a long-term carbon storage solution. To investigate the viability of this carbon storage solution, 175 tonnes of pure CO2 and 73 tonnes of a 75% CO2-24% H2S-1% H2-gas mixture were sequentially injected into basaltic rocks as a dissolved aqueous fluid at the CarbFix site at Hellisheidi, SW-Iceland. This paper reports the Mg stable isotope compositions of sub-surface fluids sampled prior to, during, and after the CO2 injections. These Mg isotopic compositions are used to trace the fate of this element during the subsurface carbonation of basalts. The measured Mg isotopic compositions of the monitoring well fluids are isotopically lighter than the dissolving basalts and continue to become increasingly lighter for at least two years after the gas-charged water injection was stopped. The results indicate that the formation of isotopically heavy Mg-clays rather than Mg-carbonates are the predominant Mg secondary phases precipitating from the sampled fluids. Isotope mass balance calculations suggest that more than 70% of the Mg liberated from the basalt by the injected gas charged water was precipitated as Mg-clays, with this percentage increasing with time after the injection, consistent with the continued precipitation of Mg clays over the whole of the study period. The formation of Mg clays in response to the injection of CO2 into basalts, as indicated in this study, could be detrimental to carbon storage efforts because the formation of these minerals consume divalent Mg that could otherwise be used for the formation of carbonate minerals and because such clays could decrease host rock permeability.},

	abstract = {Magnesium is a major constituent in silicate and carbonate minerals, the hydrosphere and the biosphere. Magnesium is constantly cycled between these reservoirs. Since each of the major planetary reservoirs of magnesium have different magnesium isotope ratios, there is scope to use magnesium isotope ratios to trace 1) the processes that cycle Magnesium at a spatial scales from the entire planet to microscopic and 2) the relative fluxes between these reservoirs. This review summarises some of the key motivations, successes and challenges facing the use of magnesium isotopes to construct a budget of seawater magnesium, present and past.},

@article{Hindshaw:2020aa,
	abstract = {The direction and magnitude of magnesium (Mg) isotope fractionation attendant to the formation of clay minerals is fundamental to the use of Mg isotopes to decipher the biogeochemical cycling of Mg in the critical zone and for the oceanic Mg budget. This study provides experimental data on the Mg fractionation factor for two smectite-group minerals (stevensite and saponite) at temperatures relevant for Earth surface processes. The resultant solids were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) to confirm the mineralogy and crystallinity of the product. A series of experiments were performed to asses the impact of temperature and pH on isotope fractionation. Bulk solid samples were treated with ammonium chloride to remove exchangeable Mg in order to distinguish the Mg isotopic fractionation between these sites and octahedral sites. All bulk and residual solids were enriched in 24Mg compared to the initial solution and δ26Mg values of the exchangeable pool were lower than, or within error of, the initial solution. Final solutions were either within error of, or enriched in, 26Mg compared to the initial solution, depending on the fraction of Mg removed from solution (fMg). For experiments with small or negligible fMg, increasing the pH resulted in a higher reaction rate and reduced fractionation from the initial solution. This could point to a kinetic effect, but the composition of the residual solid (Mg/(Li+Mg) ratio) was also dependent on pH. The change in the composition was reflected in the wavenumber of the Mg3-OH stretch in FT-IR data, which is a proxy for bond strength, and suggests an equilibrium control. An equilibrium control is further supported by the observation of reduced fractionation compared to the initial solution with increasing temperature. Rayleigh and batch fractionation models were fitted to the data giving fractionation factors of 0.9991 and 0.9990 respectively. We compare our results with existing field and experimental data and suggest that the apparent contradictions surrounding the direction of Mg isotope fractionation into phyllosilicate minerals could be due to the similarity of Mg bond lengths between clay octahedral sites and dissolved Mg. Thus small changes in mineral structure or initial solution conditions may result in a change in bond length sufficient to alter the direction of fractionation, implying that the magnitude and direction of Mg isotope fractionation into clay minerals could be dependent on local field conditions. Alternatively, if the precipitation of secondary clay minerals in the field preferentially incorporates light Mg, as observed in this experimental study, this implies the contribution of carbonate weathering to dissolved Mg fluxes has been underestimated, with major implications for the global biogeochemical cycle of Mg.},
