\marginnote{This is an R markdown document.  It is similar to a jupyter notebook that you might be more familiar with.  You can both explore the code, and also compile the final document to pdf output.  This should provide you with some familiarisation of "R", as well as the science.}


This practical will take place on your laptops via a web-browser (hopefully).  Navigate to moodle in a web browser and click on the link to the CarFix practical.  This will open a Binder webpage which will compile into an interface that is identical to the RStudio App.  Some of you will be familiar with this app, but if you have never used if before you will. need to spend a few minutes familiarising yourself with it and making sure you know how to run R.

\noindent The CarbFix\marginnote{Those of you who took petrology at PII may well have heard about CarbFix already.} project in Iceland was created to develop the technology to store carbon dioxide as stable carbonate minerals directly in the subsurface by reacting gas charged injection waters with basaltic rocks.  Carbon storage in basaltic rocks offers numerous advantages including their ability to promote mineral carbonation and their large potential storage volume.  Numerous studies have focused on developing the technology to safely store \carb\ in basaltic rocks including laboratory experiments, modelling and field studies.   Basaltic rocks are rich in divalent cations such as \ce{Ca^{2+}}, \ce{Mg^{2+}}, and \ce{Fe^{2+}}. The injection of acidic water enriched in \ce{CO2} promotes the release of these cations\marginnote{\ce{Fe^{2+}} is not a typical cation in natural waters.  Think about why it is a cation in these particular waters}, potentially leading to the formation of carbonate minerals such as calcite, magnesite, and siderite as the continued dissolution of basalt increases the pH of the aqueous fluid.  About 5% of the continents and most of the oceanic floor are comprised of basaltic rocks, including the mid-oceanic ridges. As such the largest basaltic storage potential lies offshore; theoretically all \ce{CO2} from the burning of fossil fuel carbon (estimated to be ca. 5000Gt)\marginnote{Do you remember how much carbon is in the ocean-atmosphere system?}. The flanks of mid-ocean ridges contain highly fractured and permeable basaltic layers with a pervasive hydrothermal circulation of about 1000Gt seawater/yr. Lab results have demonstrated that basaltic rocks dissolve rapidly in seawater which is rich in \carb. 
\marginnote{Note that there has already been a sequel to CarbFix, CarbFix2, which now has a sequel "Seastone"}


The CarbFix injection site is equipped with a 2000m deep injection well and 8 monitoring wells ranging in depth from 50 to 1300m in depth. The subsurface rocks at the injection site are primarily olivine tholeiite basalts consisting of lava flows and hyaloclastite formations. The hyaloclastites are relatively low permeability glassy rocks formed under ice and melt water during glaciations; the boundaries between hyaloclastites and lava flows, and those between individual lava flows boundaries are preferential fluid flow pathways. Some alteration is observed in the hyaloclastite rocks starting at 120–300m depth. The common alteration minerals at this depth are smectite, calcite, Ca-rich zeolites, and poorly crystalline iron-hydroxides. 

Fluid injection was targeted at a lava flow sequence located 400–800m below the surface with the main aquifer located at ca.530m depth. Loss on ignition measurements on rock samples suggest that over 80% of the primary rocks in the target zone are currently unaltered. Tracer tests were conducted both under natural and forced flow conditions from 2008 to 2011 to define the system hydrology. These tests indicated that the flow from the HN-02 injection well to the first monitoring well (HN-04) consists of relatively homogenous porous media intersected by a low volume and fast flow path that channels about 3% of the tracer flow.

\carb\ was injected dissolved in seawater in two phases (phase I and phase II). The injection fluid was spiked with  nonreactive but volatile sulfur hexafluoride (\ce{SF6}) and trifluoromethyl sulfur pentafluoride (\ce{SF5CF3}) tracers to assess plume migration in the reservoir.  The \ce{SF6} was used during phase I and \ce{SF5CF3} during phase II.

Because dissolved or mineralized \ce{CO2} cannot be detected by conventional monitoring methods such as seismic imaging, the fate of the injected \ce{CO2} was monitored with a suite of chemical and isotopic tracers. The injected \ce{CO2} was spiked with carbon-14 (\ce{14C}) to monitor its transport and reactivity.

# QUESTION:  What happens to DIC at the monitoring well during the injection period?  Suggest possible explanations.



The fate of the injected \ce{CO2} was quantified using mass balance calculations.   The mixing fraction between the injected solution ($IS$) and ambient groundwater ($GW$) was calculated for each extracted water sample (i) using:
\begin{equation}
[SF_6]_i=X[SF_6]_{IS}+(1-X)[SF_6]_{GW}
\end{equation}\marginnote{This kind of simple mass balance equation should be familiar to you and you should expect to know how to formulate and use it.}
with $X$ being the fraction of injected solution in the extracted water sample

# TASK: Compute the mixing fraction X for each of the samples in the @Matter:2016aa dataset.  Note that the \ce{SF6} and \ce{SF5CF3} concentrations in the injected fluids were $2.33 \times 10^{-8} cc$ at standard temperature and pressure (ccSTP)/cc and $2.24 \times 10^{-8}$ ccSTP/cc, respectively. Assume that the concentrations of \ce{SF6} and \ce{SF5CF3} in ambient groundwater are zero.
```{r Calculate X from passive tracer, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

Matter_2016<-Matter_2016%>%mutate(X_SF6=(`SF6 (ccSTP/cc)  Phase1`-GW_SF6)/(IS_SF6-GW_SF6))

```

\noindent The expected DIC  values due to pure mixing between the injected fluid and ambient groundwater can be determined from:
\begin{equation}
DIC_{mix}=X[DIC]_{IS}+(1-X)DIC_{GW}
\end{equation}
This is the DIC that would be expected assuming conservative mixing based on the \ce{SF_6} data.  The alkalinity of the groundwater from monitoring well HN-4 was 1.91meq/L and the pH was 9.43 at 20C.  Remember that alkalinity is not the same as DIC, but DIC can be calculated from the alkalinity given the pH.

The fast conversion rate of dissolved \ce{CO2} to calcite minerals in the CarbFix storage reservoir is most likely the result of several key processes: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The novel \ce{CO2} injection system that injected water-dissolved \ce{CO2} into the subsurface
\item The relatively rapid dissolution rate of basalt, releasing Ca, Mg, and Fe ions required for the \ce{CO2} mineralization,
\item The mixing of injected water with alkaline formation waters,
\item The dissolution of preexisting secondary carbonates at the onset of the \ce{CO2} injection, which may have contributed to the neutralization of the injected \ce{CO2}-rich water via the reaction $\sf CaCO_3 + CO_2 + H_2O = Ca^{2+} + 2 HCO3^-$.
\end{enumerate}




\noindent The efficiency of mineral carbonation, however, can be limited if Mg clay minerals rather than Mg carbonate minerals form in response to the injection of \ce{CO2} into basalts. Magnesium clay formation is detrimental to carbon storage efforts because these minerals consume divalent Mg that could otherwise be used for carbonate mineral formation, and because Mg-bearing clays could decrease host rock permeability.  Mg has three stable isotopes ($^{24}Mg$, $^{25}Mg$ and $^{26}Mg$) which are thought to be fractionated by the formation of clay minerals @Hindshaw:2020aa.

\marginnote{The "dots" at the end of the boxplot represent outliers. There are a number of different rules for determining if a point is an outlier, but the method that R and ggplot use is the "1.5 rule". Outliers are defined by:  
\begin{enumerate}
\item less than $Q1 - 1.5*IQR$
\item greater than $Q3 + 1.5*IQR$
\end{enumerate}
Where Q refers to a quartile.
The whiskers are defined as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $upper whisker = min(max(x), Q_3 + 1.5 * IQR)$
\item $lower whisker = max(min(x), Q_1 – 1.5 * IQR)$
\end{enumerate}
The box is defined by the interquartile range ($IQR = Q_3 – Q_1$) 
}

# QUESTION:  Which of the data categories on the plot suggest that clay might fractionate Mg isotopes?

\noindent If you are interested in this you can read more in @Tipper:2022aa

# QUESTION:  What do you note about the range of Silicate rock?  (Hint: Look at the box).

\noindent  Mg isotope ratios have been measured on the fluids from the monitoring well @OELKERS2018.
# TASK:  Read in the data from @OELKERS2018
```{r Read in Oelkrs_data, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#Define what to do if there is missing data
na_strings <- c("NA", "n.d.", "N/A", "na","n.a.","","-","–","-9999","NAN")
#Define a filename
filename<-"Oelkers_2019.xlsx"
#Read in the data from xlsx

Oelkers_2019<-as.data.frame(read_excel(filename, na = na_strings, skip=0, sheet="Sheet2", col_names = TRUE))

# TASK:  Make a graph of $\sf \delta^{26}Mg$ versus time.

# QUESTIONS:  By comparing the Mg isotope dta from Carbfix, with the global compilation of Mg isotope whot do you infer is happening.  Consider 1)  What controlled the  $\sf \delta^{26}Mg$ prior to injection.  How doe the  $\sf \delta^{26}Mg$ values compare to the composition of basalt and seawater?  Do the data reflect the precipitation of carbonate minerals? Do the data reflect the precipitation of clay minerals?
